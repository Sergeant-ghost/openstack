DevStack should be run as a non-root user with `sudo` enabled. Standard logins to cloud images such as “ubuntu” or “cloud-user” are usually fine.

If you are not using a cloud image, you can create a separate stack user:

```bash
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
```

Ensure the home directory for the stack user has executable permissions for all:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/stack
```

Grant the stack user `sudo` privileges:

```bash
echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack
```

Switch to the stack user:

```bash
sudo -u stack -i
```
